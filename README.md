### Description

Did a complete rewrite of the core functionality in order to make the control a self contained container, with no need to code anything in the user form.

Latest version can be found here.

A control that allows programmers to extend the aviable space in their forms, adding the posibility of show scrollbars

I have added support for the Mouse Wheel,

and when a control that has focus is out of viewing range it will now place it in viewing range.
